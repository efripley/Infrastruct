Infrastruct Version 1.0

/***** Concept *****/
Play in a procedurally generated finite world where you harvest resources and
build machines to create new items and blocks. Build vast infrastructure of
water power and roads to support an ever complex system of automated crafting
machines. Use these machines to supply your ever expanding world. This is a
game of resource managment and construction of infrastructure to support larger
and better cities. Support the people in your cities who operate the machines
by building them a house with the basics (Sink, water, oven, electricity, light,
bed and fridge). Industrial crafting machines need the support of offices so
build offices to and employ them to get automated crafting started.
